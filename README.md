# Book Recommender System Project

This project demonstrates how to build a collaborative filtering-based book recommender system. The system leverages user ratings to recommend books to users with similar preferences. It includes:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Preparing user-item data for model training.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Implementing algorithms to find user similarities and generate recommendations.
- **Model Integration:** Applying the model to create practical recommendations for users.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script to start the recommender system.
